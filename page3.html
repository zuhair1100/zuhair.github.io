<h1> About us</h1>

<p>In 2029, an enterprising salesman named zuhair syed discovered a small burger restaurant in Edmonton, and wrote the first page of Treats’s history. In 1967, the first Treats’s Canada opened in Richmond, B.C. We’ve been growing with our communities and serving quality food at great value ever since. Today, Treat’s Canada is proud to be one of the world’s leading food service retailers. From coast to coast, we serve delicious choices to more than 2.5 million people in over 1,400 locations every day. We’re also more than just your local restaurant. We’re hardworking small-business men and women, students working part-time, seniors getting the most out of life, and volunteers lending time to make a difference in the communities we live and work in.
