    <p style="font-size:15px;"> Importent note <br>
      At Treats’s, we take great care to serve quality, great-tasting menu items to our guests each and every time they visit our restaurants. We understand that each of our guests has individual needs and considerations when choosing a place to eat or drink outside their home, especially those guests with food allergies. As part of our commitment to you, we provide the most current ingredient information available from our food suppliers for the ten priority food allergens identified by Health Canada (eggs, milk, mustard, peanuts, seafood [including fish, crustaceans and shellfish], sulphites, sesame, soy, tree nuts, and wheat and other cereal grains so that our guests with food allergies can make informed food selections. However, we also want you to know that despite taking precautions, normal kitchen operations may involve some shared storage, cooking and preparation areas, equipment, utensils and displays, and the possibility exists for your food items to come in contact with other food products, including other allergens. We encourage our guests with food allergies or special dietary needs to visit or the treats’s mobile app for ingredient information, and consult their doctor for questions regarding their diet. Due to the individualized nature of food allergies and food sensitivities, guests’ physicians may be best positioned to make recommendations for guests with food allergies and special dietary needs. If you have questions about our food, please reach out to the treat’s Guest Relations Contact Centre at 1-999-888-2222. Thank you</p>
